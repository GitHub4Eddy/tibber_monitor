# tibber_monitor

This QuickApp gets todays and tomorrows energy prices and current energy consumption from the Tibber platform. 
Next to the current prices the mimimum, maximum and average prices and percentage +/- related to the average price for today and tomorrow are calculated. 
Tax and extra cost (cable owner) are included in the hourly, daily, monthly, yearly and total cost.  
All values are displayed in the labels. Colors show the price levels in the labels:
ðŸŸ¢ VERY CHEAP
ðŸŸ¡ CHEAP
ðŸŸ  NORMAL
ðŸ”´ EXPENSIVE
ðŸŸ£ VERY EXPENSIVE

The Energy Panel is updated with the hourly prices and energy consumption. 
Several languages are supported. 

Child devices are available for:
- Hour-1 Energy (Energy usage of the previous hour)
- Hour-1 Cost (Energy cost of the previous hour)
- Daily Energy (usage in kWh)
- Daily Cost (energy and extra cost separately in the log text)
- Monthly Energy (usage in kWh)
- Monthly Cost (energy and extra cost separately in the log text)
- Yearly Energy (usage in kWh)
- Yearly Cost (energy and extra cost separately in the log text)
- Total Energy (usage in kWh, devicetype com.fibaro.energyMeter and automatic rateType=consumption for Fibaro Energy Panel)
- Total Cost (energy and extra cost separately in the log text)
- Current Price (hour and price level in the log text)
- Minimum Today Price (hour and price level in the log text)
- Maximum Today Price (hour and price level in the log text)
- Average Today Price (hour and price level in the log text)
- 24x Child devices for the Today prices from 1 to 24 hour (price level in the log text)
- Minimum Tomorrow Price (hour and price level in the log text)
- Maximum Tomorrow Price (hour and price level in the log text)
- Average Tomorrow Price (hour and price level in the log text)
- 24x Child devices for the Tomorrow prices from 1 to 24 hour (price level in the log text)

For easy use in for example blockscenes, Global Variables are available for:
- 24x Today Price Level 1-24 hour (VERY CHEAP, CHEAP, NORMAL, EXPENSIVE, VERY EXPENSIVE)
- 24x Tomorrow Price Level 1-24 hour (VERY CHEAP, CHEAP, NORMAL, EXPENSIVE, VERY EXPENSIVE)
- 24x Today Price Percentage 1-24 hour (Price related to today average price)
- 24x Tomorrow Price Percentage 1-24 hour (Price related to tomorrow average price)

These devices and global variables can be used to control appliances according to the lowest and forecast prices.

To communicate with the API you need to acquire a OAuth access token and pass this along with every request passed to the server.
A Personal Access Token give you access to your data and your data only. 
This is ideal for DIY people that want to leverage the Tibber platform to extend the smartness of their home. 
Such a token can be acquired here: https://developer.tibber.com

When creating your access token or OAuth client youâ€™ll be asked which scopes you want the access token to be associated with. 
These scopes tells the API which data and operations the client is allowed to perform on the userâ€™s behalf. 
The scopes your app requires depend on the type of data it is trying to request. 
If you for example need access to user information you add the USER scope. 
If information about the user's homes is needed you add the appropriate HOME scopes.

Tomorrow values are available from 13:00 hour
If you have more than one home in your subscription, you need to fill in your home number the change between your homes. 
Known limitation: In case of the change due to daylight saving time, the 02:00 hour is skipped going to summer, only 23 price values are available

ToDo, maybe (?)
- Setup current hour price with current date/time and not from Tibber response
- Energy prices and cost insertion in Energy Panel not hourly but once a day
- In case of error: retry or wait for next interval (that is the current method)
- Show prices in cents
- Activate simulation if use of demo token

- Added color ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ ðŸ”´ðŸŸ£ to the prices in the labels based on the Tibber price level
- Added todays energy usage per hour to the labels
- Deleted today PRICES from the global variables, because they are available in the child devices
- Added global variables for tomorrow price LEVELS (the today global variables were already there)
- Added global variables for today price PERCENTAGES 
- Added global variables for tomorrow price PERCENTAGES 
- Changed the name of the global variables to get a better sorting in the dashboard
- Added separate QuickApp variables to activate today and or tomorrow global variables
- Changed to QuickApp variable secondsH (interval) to how many seconds after the whole hour the QuickApp should run, so the QuickApp now runs once an hour a few minutes after the whole hour

Changes version 2.1 (25th June 2022)

Changes version 2.0 (25th May 2022)
- Changed the device for the energy panel from the Daily Energy to the Total Energy child device. Because Tibber reports always the past hour at the start of the new hour (so always too late) and the Energy panel and the Daily Energy child devices both resets at midnight and the Total Energy child device doesn't resets, that prevents the last hour from not getting into the energy panel. Thanks to @JcBorgs for analysing and testing. 
- Added workaround with the help of @JcBorgs for a Tibber API bug in 00-01 hour consumption (energy and cost can change to "null" during the day)

- Added insert of hour-1 price in Energy Panel (can be turned on or off) with help of @JcBorgs
- Changed the name of all child devices Percentage to dynamic names like "At hour 16:00", "At hour 17:00", etc. with help of @jgab and @JcBorgs
- Changed handling of no response from Tibber
- Removed user defined icon (not necessary anymore)
